Elastic Net Grid Sampling
=========================

When fitting a Bézier simplex to the elastic-net regularization map you first need to
choose a set of weight vectors on the standard 2-simplex :math:`\Delta^2` at which to
evaluate the model.
The :func:`~torch_bsf.model_selection.elastic_net_grid.elastic_net_grid` function
generates a purpose-built grid that respects the intrinsic geometry of the elastic-net
hyperparameter space.


The Hyperparameter Space
------------------------

The standard Elastic Net regression problem is formulated as:

.. math::

   \min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^N} \frac{1}{2n}\|y - X\beta\|_2^2
   + \lambda \Bigl(\alpha \|\beta\|_1 + \frac{1-\alpha}{2}\|\beta\|_2^2\Bigr)

where :math:`\lambda \ge 0` is the overall regularization strength and
:math:`\alpha \in [0, 1]` controls the L1/L2 mixing ratio
(setting :math:`\alpha = 1` recovers the Lasso; :math:`\alpha = 0` gives Ridge regression).

To cast this into the multi-objective framework, we identify three objectives over
:math:`\beta \in \mathbb{R}^N`:

.. math::

   f_{\text{data}}(\beta) &= \frac{1}{2n}\|y - X\beta\|_2^2 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\|\beta\|_2^2 \\
   f_{\text{sparse}}(\beta) &= \|\beta\|_1 + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\|\beta\|_2^2 \\
   f_{\text{smooth}}(\beta) &= \frac{1 + \epsilon}{2}\|\beta\|_2^2

where :math:`n` is the number of observations and :math:`\epsilon > 0` is a small constant.
It appears as :math:`\frac{\epsilon}{2}\|\beta\|_2^2` in :math:`f_{\text{data}}` and
:math:`f_{\text{sparse}}` to make those terms strongly convex, and it is absorbed into
:math:`f_{\text{smooth}}` via the coefficient :math:`\frac{1+\epsilon}{2}`.
This ensures all three objectives are strongly convex, which is required for the solution
map to be weakly simplicial; see :doc:`../whatis` for a detailed discussion.

Equivalently, elastic-net optimization can be written as a convex combination of the
same three objectives:

.. math::

   \min_{\beta} \; w_1 \, f_{\text{data}}(\beta)
               + w_2 \, f_{\text{sparse}}(\beta)
               + w_3 \, f_{\text{smooth}}(\beta),
   \qquad (w_1, w_2, w_3) \in \Delta^2.

The conventional elastic-net parameters :math:`\lambda \ge 0` (overall
regularization strength) and :math:`\alpha \in [0, 1]` (L1 mixing ratio) relate to the
simplex weight vector by:

.. math::

   w_1 = \frac{1}{1+\lambda}, \qquad
   w_2 = \frac{\lambda\,\alpha}{1+\lambda}, \qquad
   w_3 = \frac{\lambda\,(1-\alpha)}{1+\lambda}.

With these weights the convex-combination objective equals the :math:`\epsilon`-regularized
elastic net objective divided by the positive constant :math:`(1 + \lambda)`.
Because this scale factor does not depend on :math:`\beta`, both formulations share the
same minimizer.

The :math:`(\lambda, \alpha)` parameter space is a semi-infinite rectangle
:math:`[0,\infty) \times [0,1]`.
When :math:`\lambda = 0` the regularization terms vanish and the solution depends only
on the data, *regardless of* :math:`\alpha`.
Therefore the entire edge :math:`\{\lambda = 0\} \times [0, 1]` maps to the single
vertex :math:`(w_1, w_2, w_3) = (1, 0, 0)` of the simplex.
Identifying this edge with a single point transforms the rectangle into a triangle – the 2-simplex :math:`\Delta^2`.

Conversely, as :math:`\lambda \to \infty` the regularization overwhelms the data term
and drives all model coefficients to zero, regardless of :math:`\alpha`.
In the elastic net this limit is called the **null model** (all :math:`\beta_i = 0`).
All weight vectors on the opposite edge of the simplex
:math:`\{(w_1, w_2, w_3) : w_1 = 0\}` — the *base edge* connecting
:math:`(0, 1, 0)` and :math:`(0, 0, 1)` — therefore correspond to the same solution.
Since the Bézier simplex (and the underlying solution map) must assign a single output
to each input weight, all of these base-edge weights are identified with a single
null-model point :math:`P^*` in the solution space. The
:func:`~torch_bsf.model_selection.elastic_net_grid.elastic_net_grid` function still
returns multiple distinct base-edge weights (:math:`w_1 = 0` with varying :math:`w_2`,
:math:`w_3`), but they all evaluate to this same null-model solution. The resulting
quotient space is a **leaf/eye-shaped CW complex**: two 0-cells (:math:`A` and
:math:`P^*`), two 1-cells (the former edges :math:`AB` and :math:`AC`, now connecting
:math:`A` to :math:`P^*` as curves), and one 2-cell (the interior).

This identification gives the interior a **leaf (foliation) structure**: for each fixed
value of :math:`w_1 \in (0, 1]`, the set of corresponding weight vectors
:math:`\{(w_1, w_2, w_3) : w_2 + w_3 = 1 - w_1,\; w_2, w_3 \ge 0\}`
is a line segment (a *leaf*) parametrized by :math:`\alpha`.
As :math:`w_1 \to 0` (i.e. :math:`\lambda \to \infty`), the images of these leaves
under the solution map shrink to the single null-model point :math:`P^*`.

.. figure:: ../_static/elastic_net_leaf_space.png
   :width: 100%

   All points are colored by :math:`(w_1, w_2, w_3) \mapsto (R, G, B)`,
   so the same weight vector has the same color in every panel.
   **Left** – The :math:`(\lambda, \alpha)` hyperparameter space (x: regularization
   strength, y: L1 mixing ratio).
   The red line at :math:`\lambda = 0` is the identified edge; all points on it
   share the color :math:`(1, 0, 0)` = red because :math:`w = (1, 0, 0)` there.
   **Center** – The 2-simplex with vertices :math:`(1,0,0)` at the bottom-left (red),
   :math:`(0,1,0)` at the top (green), and :math:`(0,0,1)` at the
   bottom-right (blue).
   The gradient right edge (green→blue) is the null-model base edge to be identified.
   **Right** – The quotient space: vertex :math:`A` = :math:`(1,0,0)` (red) at the
   left, and the null-model point :math:`P^*` at the right shown as a large green dot
   :math:`(0,1,0)` behind a smaller blue dot :math:`(0,0,1)`, reflecting that both
   endpoints of the base edge are identified to :math:`P^*`.


Grid Structure
--------------

A uniform grid in :math:`(\lambda, \alpha)` is sub-optimal because solutions change
rapidly near :math:`\lambda = 0` and slowly for large :math:`\lambda`.
:func:`~torch_bsf.model_selection.elastic_net_grid.elastic_net_grid` therefore uses:

* **Log-scale spacing in the data-fidelity weight coordinate** :math:`w_1` – the
  :func:`~torch_bsf.model_selection.elastic_net_grid.reverse_logspace` routine
  generates ``n_lambdas - 1`` values of :math:`w_1 \in [0, 1)` that serve as
  :math:`w_1`-levels for iso-:math:`w_1` leaves, including :math:`w_1 = 0` (which
  lies on the null-model base edge and corresponds to :math:`\lambda = \infty`) and
  excluding the data-fidelity vertex at :math:`w_1 = 1`.
  The vertex at :math:`w_1 = 1` (i.e. :math:`\lambda = 0`) is appended separately.
  As :math:`w_1` increases from 0 towards 1, these levels move from the base edge
  into the simplex interior towards the data-fidelity vertex.  Since
  :math:`\lambda = (1 - w_1) / w_1` is finite only for :math:`w_1 > 0`, all finite
  values of :math:`\lambda` arise from :math:`0 < w_1 < 1`.
  The log spacing in :math:`w_1` produces more :math:`w_1` levels close to the
  data-fidelity vertex and therefore near :math:`\lambda = 0`.
  The steepness of this clustering is controlled by the ``base`` parameter:
  ``base=1`` gives uniform spacing in :math:`w_1`, while larger values concentrate
  points further towards :math:`w_1 = 1` (i.e. towards smaller :math:`\lambda`).

* **Uniform spacing along** :math:`\alpha` – for each :math:`w_1` level, the
  ``n_alphas`` values of :math:`\alpha` are placed uniformly in :math:`[0, 1]` to
  span the corresponding iso-:math:`w_1` leaf.

The ``n_vertex_copies`` parameter adds extra copies of each simplex vertex.
This is useful when the grid is passed to k-fold cross-validation
(see :doc:`auto_degree`): set ``n_vertex_copies >= k`` for k-fold CV so that,
when the fold-splitting procedure distributes rows approximately evenly, each fold
will contain every vertex at least once.  Using fewer copies than folds can inflate
cross-validation variance.

.. figure:: ../_static/elastic_net_grid_comparison.png
   :width: 100%

   Grid points on the 2-simplex for different values of the ``base`` parameter
   (``n_lambdas=20``, ``n_alphas=10``).  Larger bases push more points towards the
   data-fidelity vertex :math:`(1, 0, 0)` (bottom-left corner in the figure),
   which is appropriate when you expect the optimal model to have small
   :math:`\lambda`.


Usage
-----

As a Python Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from torch_bsf.model_selection.elastic_net_grid import elastic_net_grid

   # Generate a grid with 102 lambda levels, 12 alpha levels, and 10 vertex
   # copies (useful for 10-fold cross-validation).
   grid = elastic_net_grid(
       n_lambdas=102,
       n_alphas=12,
       n_vertex_copies=10,
       base=10,
   )
   # grid.shape == (1240, 3)
   # Each row is a weight vector (w1, w2, w3) on the 2-simplex.

   np.savetxt("weights.csv", grid, delimiter=",", fmt="%.17e")

The returned array can be saved to a CSV file and then either (a) loaded back into an
array or tensor and passed as the ``params`` argument to :func:`torch_bsf.fit`, or
(b) passed as a file path to the ``--params`` CLI option, to train a Bézier simplex
over the elastic-net regularization map.

As a Python Module (CLI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the module directly to print the grid as a CSV file to *stdout*:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m torch_bsf.model_selection.elastic_net_grid \
       --n_lambdas=102 \
       --n_alphas=12 \
       --n_vertex_copies=10 \
       --base=10 \
       > weights.csv

All four parameters are optional and fall back to their defaults
(``n_lambdas=102``, ``n_alphas=12``, ``n_vertex_copies=1``, ``base=10``).

Via MLproject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``elastic_net_grid`` entry point in ``MLproject`` calls the same module and
redirects the output to a CSV file named
``weight_{n_lambdas}_{n_alphas}_{n_vertex_copies}_{base}.csv``:

.. code-block:: bash

   mlflow run https://github.com/opthub-org/pytorch-bsf \
       -e elastic_net_grid \
       -P n_lambdas=102 \
       -P n_alphas=12 \
       -P n_vertex_copies=10 \
       -P base=10

After the run completes, the grid is saved in the current working directory as
``weight_102_12_10_10.csv``.  You can then pass it as the ``params`` argument to a
subsequent training run:

.. code-block:: bash

   mlflow run https://github.com/opthub-org/pytorch-bsf \
       -P params=weight_102_12_10_10.csv \
       -P values=values.csv \
       -P degree=6
